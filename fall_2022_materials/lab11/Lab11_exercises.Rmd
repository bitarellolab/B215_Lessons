### Contingency analysis problems

1. Spousal Grief (Chapter 9, problem 29)

It is common wisdom that death of a spouse can lead to health deterioration of the partner left behind. Is common wisdom right or wrong in this case? To investigate, Maddison and Viola (1968) measured the degree of health deterioration of 132 widows in the Boston area, all of whose husbands had died at the age of 45–60 within a fixed six-month period before the study. A total of 28 of the 132 widows had experienced a marked deterioration in health, 47 had seen a moderate deterioration, and 57 had seen no deterioration in health. Of 98 control women with similar characteristics who had not lost their husbands, 7 saw a marked deterioration in health over the same time period, 31 experienced a moderate deterioration of health, and 60 saw no deterioration. 

A) Test whether the pattern of health deterioration was different between the two groups of women.
Give the  as precisely as possible from the statistical tables.


B) Now use R to check your answer:

```{r}
#your code

```

C) Interpret your result in words:




2. Kuru disease (Chapter 9, problem 35)

Kuru is a prion disease of the Fore people of highland New Guinea. It was once transmitted by the consumption of deceased relatives at mortuary feasts, a ritual that was ended by about 1960. Using archived tissue samples, Mead et al. (2009) investigated genetic variants that might confer resistance to kuru. The data in the accompanying table are genotypes at codon 129 of the prion protein gene of young and elderly individuals all having the disease. Since the elderly individuals have survived long exposure to kuru, unusually common genotypes in this group might indicate resistant genotypes. The file is `input_files/kuru.csv`.

A) Illustrate these data with a grouped bar graph. Which genotype(s) are especially prevalent in the elderly compared with young individuals?

### Using webapps to get a feel for the normal distribution and the central limit theorem

We return to the applet we used in tutorial 3, located at http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/Kingfisher/SamplingNormal.htm to investigate three points made in the text.


* Point 1: The distribution of sample means is normal, if the variable itself has a normal distribution. First, hit “COMPLETE SAMPLE OF 10” and “CALCULATE MEAN” a few times, to remind yourself of what this applet does. (It takes a sample from the normal distribution shown when you click “SHOW POPULATION”. The top panel shows a histogram of that sample, and the bottom panel shows the distribution of sample means from all the previous samples.)


* Next, hit the “MEANS FOR MANY SAMPLES” button. This button makes a large number of separate samples at one go, all of the same sample size, to save you from making the samples one by one. Notice that the sample mean differs from sample to sample. The sample mean produced by random sampling from a probability distribution is itself a random variable.


A) Look at the distribution of sample means. Does it seem to have a normal distribution? Click the checkbox by “SHOW SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION” off to the right, which will draw the curve for a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as this distribution of sample means.

Answer:



* Point 2: The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is reduced with larger sample sizes. The standard deviation of the population is controlled by the right slider marked with $\sigma$. The sample size is set by left slider. (The default when it opens is set to n=10.)

B) For $n=10$, have the applet calculate a large number of sample means as you did in the previous exercise. If each sample size is 10 and the standard deviation is 30 (as in the default).
What do you predict the standard deviation of the sample means to be? (Use the equation you have learned in class to make this calculation.)

Answer:


C) Change the sample size to $n=100$, and recalculate many sample means. Calculate the predicted standard deviation of all the sample means. Should the sampling distribution of sample means be wider or narrower with this larger sample size than in the previous case with a smaller sample size? What do you observe in the simulations?



* Point 3: The distribution of sample means is approximately normal no matter what the distribution of the variable, as long as the sample size is large enough. (The Central Limit Theorem) Load another web page: http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/Kingfisher/CLT.htm

This will simulate a very skewed distribution of data, showing the number of cups of coffee drunk per week for a population of university students. Click on “COFFEE” to see the distribution of the variable among individual students. Describe the ways that this looks different from a normal distribution.

D) Set $n=2$ for the sample size, and simulate many sample means. Does the distribution of sample means look normal? Is it closer to normal in its shape than the distribution of individuals in the population?

Answer:


E) Now set $n=25$ and simulate many sample means. How does the distribution of sample means look now? It should look much more like a normal distribution, because of the Central Limit Theorem.

### Normal Distribution exercises
1.Let’s use R’s random number generator for the normal distribution to build intuition for how to view and interpret histograms and QQ plots. Remember, the lists of values generated by rnorm() come from a population that truly have a normal distribution.

A) Generate a list of 10 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 15 and standard deviation 3 and save the results to `normal_vector`:

```{r}
#your code

```

B) Use hist() to plot a histogram of these numbers from part a.
```{r}
#your code
```

C) Plot a QQ plot from the numbers in part a.
```{r}
#your code

```
D) Repeat a through c several times (at least a dozen times). For each, look at the histograms and QQ plots. Think about the ways in which these look different from the expectation of a normal distribution (but remember that each of these samples comes from a truly normal population).

```{r}
#your code
```

Observations:





2. Repeat the procedures of Question 1, except this time have R sample 250 individuals for each sample. (You can use the same command as in Question 1, but now set n = 250.) Do the graphs and QQ plots from these larger samples look more like the normal expectations than the smaller sample you already did? Why do you think that this is?

```{r}
#your code


```

Observations:





3. In 1898, Hermon Bumpus collected house sparrows that had been caught in a severe winter storm in Chicago. He made several measurements on these sparrows, and his data are in the file “bumpus.csv”.

Bumpus used these data to observe differences between the birds that survived and those that died from the storm. This became one of the first direct and quantitative observations of natural selection on morphological traits. Here, let’s use these data to practice looking for fit of the normal distribution. (We’ll return to this data set next week to look for evidence of natural selection.)

A) Use ggplot() to plot the distribution of total length (this is the length of the bird from beak to tail). Does the data look as though it comes from distribution that is approximately normal?

```{r}

```
Answer:
B) Use qqnorm() to plot a QQ plot for total length. Does the data fall approximately along a straight line in the QQ plot? If so, what does this imply about the fit of these data to a normal distribution?

```{r}

```
Answer: 
C) Calculate the mean of total length and a 95% confidence interval for this mean. (You may want to refer back to Week 5 for the R commands to do this.)


```{r}
#your code

```
Answer:



For the problems below, use both:

1. the "manual" route (using R only as a calculator) and

11. An 1868 paper by German physician Carl Wunderlich reported, based on over a million body temperature readings, that healthy‑adult body temperatures are approximately Normal with mean 𝜇=98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (∘F) and standard deviation 𝜎=0.6∘F . This is still the most widely quoted result for human temperature.
