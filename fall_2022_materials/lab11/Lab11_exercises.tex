  Spousal Grief (Chapter 9, problem 29)
\end{enumerate}

It is common wisdom that death of a spouse can lead to health
deterioration of the partner left behind. Is common wisdom right or
wrong in this case? To investigate, Maddison and Viola (1968) measured
the degree of health deterioration of 132 widows in the Boston area, all
of whose husbands had died at the age of 45--60 within a fixed six-month
period before the study. A total of 28 of the 132 widows had experienced
a marked deterioration in health, 47 had seen a moderate deterioration,
and 57 had seen no deterioration in health. Of 98 control women with
similar characteristics who had not lost their husbands, 7 saw a marked
deterioration in health over the same time period, 31 experienced a
moderate deterioration of health, and 60 saw no deterioration.

  Kuru disease (Chapter 9, problem 35)
\end{enumerate}

Kuru is a prion disease of the Fore people of highland New Guinea. It
was once transmitted by the consumption of deceased relatives at
mortuary feasts, a ritual that was ended by about 1960. Using archived
tissue samples, Mead et al.~(2009) investigated genetic variants that
might confer resistance to kuru. The data in the accompanying table are
genotypes at codon 129 of the prion protein gene of young and elderly
individuals all having the disease. Since the elderly individuals have
survived long exposure to kuru, unusually common genotypes in this group
might indicate resistant genotypes. The file is
\texttt{input\_files/kuru.csv}.

\subsubsection{Using webapps to get a feel for the normal distribution
and the central limit
theorem}\label{using-webapps-to-get-a-feel-for-the-normal-distribution-and-the-central-limit-theorem}}

We return to the applet we used in tutorial 3, located at
\url{http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/Kingfisher/SamplingNormal.htm}
to investigate three points made in the text.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Point 1: The distribution of sample means is normal, if the variable
  itself has a normal distribution. First, hit ``COMPLETE SAMPLE OF 10''
  and ``CALCULATE MEAN'' a few times, to remind yourself of what this
  applet does. (It takes a sample from the normal distribution shown
  when you click ``SHOW POPULATION''. The top panel shows a histogram of
  that sample, and the bottom panel shows the distribution of sample
  means from all the previous samples.)
\item
  Next, hit the ``MEANS FOR MANY SAMPLES'' button. This button makes a
  large number of separate samples at one go, all of the same sample
  size, to save you from making the samples one by one. Notice that the
  sample mean differs from sample to sample. The sample mean produced by
  random sampling from a probability distribution is itself a random
  variable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Look at the distribution of sample means. Does it seem to have a
  normal distribution? Click the checkbox by ``SHOW SAMPLING
  DISTRIBUTION'' off to the right, which will draw the curve for a
  normal distribution with the same mean and variance as this
  distribution of sample means.
\end{enumerate}

Answer:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Point 2: The standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is
  reduced with larger sample sizes. The standard deviation of the
  population is controlled by the right slider marked with \(\sigma\).
  The sample size is set by left slider. (The default when it opens is
  set to n=10.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  For \(n=10\), have the applet calculate a large number of sample means
  as you did in the previous exercise. If each sample size is 10 and the
  standard deviation is 30 (as in the default). What do you predict the
  standard deviation of the sample means to be? (Use the equation you
  have learned in class to make this calculation.)
\end{enumerate}

Answer:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Change the sample size to \(n=100\), and recalculate many sample
  means. Calculate the predicted standard deviation of all the sample
  means. Should the sampling distribution of sample means be wider or
  narrower with this larger sample size than in the previous case with a
  smaller sample size? What do you observe in the simulations?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Point 3: The distribution of sample means is approximately normal no
  matter what the distribution of the variable, as long as the sample
  size is large enough. (The Central Limit Theorem) Load another web
  page: \url{http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/Kingfisher/CLT.htm}
\end{itemize}

This will simulate a very skewed distribution of data, showing the
number of cups of coffee drunk per week for a population of university
students. Click on ``COFFEE'' to see the distribution of the variable
among individual students. Describe the ways that this looks different
from a normal distribution.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Set \(n=2\) for the sample size, and simulate many sample means. Does
  the distribution of sample means look normal? Is it closer to normal
  in its shape than the distribution of individuals in the population?
\end{enumerate}

Answer:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Now set \(n=25\) and simulate many sample means. How does the
  distribution of sample means look now? It should look much more like a
  normal distribution, because of the Central Limit Theorem.
\end{enumerate}

1.Let's use R's random number generator for the normal distribution to

  In 1898, Hermon Bumpus collected house sparrows that had been caught
  in a severe winter storm in Chicago. He made several measurements on
  these sparrows, and his data are in the file ``bumpus.csv''.
\end{enumerate}

Bumpus used these data to observe differences between the birds that
survived and those that died from the storm. This became one of the
first direct and quantitative observations of natural selection on
morphological traits. Here, let's use these data to practice looking for
fit of the normal distribution. (We'll return to this data set next week
to look for evidence of natural selection.)

\item
  Use ggplot() to plot the distribution of total length (this is the
  length of the bird from beak to tail). Does the data look as though it
  comes from distribution that is approximately normal?
\end{enumerate}

Answer: B) Use qqnorm() to plot a QQ plot for total length. Does the
data fall approximately along a straight line in the QQ plot? If so,
what does this imply about the fit of these data to a normal
distribution?

Answer: C) Calculate the mean of total length and a 95\% confidence
interval for this mean. (You may want to refer back to Week 5 for the R
commands to do this.)
