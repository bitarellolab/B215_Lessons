<div id="section-missing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Missing Data</h2>
<p>Sometimes we do not have all variables measured on all individuals in
the data set. When this happens, we need a space holder in our data
files so that R knows that the data is missing. The standard way of
doing this in R is to put “NA” (without the quotes) in the location that
the data would have gone. NA is short for “not available”.</p>
<p>For example, in the Titanic data set, we do not know the age of
several passengers. Let’s look at it. Use <code>read.csv</code> to read
in the <code>titanic.csv</code> file from the <code>data</code>
directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanicData &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/titanic.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now look at age by selecting the column <code>age</code> in the
<code>titanicData</code> object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Have R print out the list of the age variable, which you can do easily by just indexing it using the $ sign.
titanicData$age</code></pre>
<p>If you look through the results, you will see that most individuals
have numbers in this list, but some have NA. These NAs are the people
for which we do not have age information.</p>
<p>By the way, the <code>titanic.csv</code> file simply has nothing in
the places where there is missing data. When R loaded it, it replaced
the empty spots with NA automatically.</p>
<p>We have already seen in lab 2 how to calculate the mean of a vector
of data using <code>mean()</code>. Unfortunately, if there are missing
data we need to tell R how to deal with it.</p>
<p>A (somewhat annoying) quirk of R is that if we try to take the mean
of a list of numbers that include missing data, we get an NA for the
result!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(titanicData$age)</code></pre>
<p>To get the mean of all the numbers that we do have, we have to add an
option to the mean() function. This option is
<code>na.rm = TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(titanicData$age, na.rm = T)</code></pre>
<p>This tells R to remove (“rm”) the NAs before taking the mean. It
turns out that the mean age of passengers that we have information for
was about 31.2.</p>
<p><code>na.rm = TRUE</code> can be added to many functions in R,
including <code>median()</code>, as we shall see next.</p>
<p>The median of a series of numbers is the “middle” number – half of
the numbers in the list are greater the median and half are below it. It
can be calculated in R by using median().</p>
<pre class="r"><code>median(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>A handy function (which you’ve seen in Lab 2) that will return both
the mean and median at the same time (along with other information such
as the first and third quartiles) is <code>summary()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(titanicData$age)</code></pre>
<p>From left to right, this output gives us the smallest (minimum) value
in the list (“Min.”), the first quartile (“1st Qu.”), the median, the
mean, the third quartile (“3rd Qu.”), the largest (maximum) value
(“Max.”), and finally, the number of individuals with missing values
(”NA’s”).</p>
<ul>
<li>The first quartile is the value in the data that is larger than a
quarter of the data points.</li>
<li>The third quartile is larger than ¾ of the data.</li>
<li>These are also called the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile,
respectively. (You may remember these from boxplots, where the top and
bottom of the box mark the 75th and 25th percentiles,
respectively.)</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-measures-of-variability" class="section level3">
<h3>Measures of variability</h3>
<p>In Lab 2 we saw variance and standard deviation. Today we will also
see coefficient of variation and interquartile ranges. We will look into
all of these when there are missing data.</p>
<p>To calculate the <em>variance</em> and <em>standard deviation</em> of
data with NAs, use <code>na.rm=T</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>var(titanicData$age)

var(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE)

sd(titanicData$age)

sd(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-coefficient-of-variation" class="section level3">
<h3>Coefficient of variation</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, there is no standard function in R to calculate the
coefficient of variation. You can do this yourself, though, directly
from the definition:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>100 * sd(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE) </code></pre>
<p>Make sure you understand the command above before continuing!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-range-and-interquartile-range" class="section level3">
<h3>Range and interquartile range</h3>
<p>Another handy function is <code>range</code>. But if we try to run it
on our data, we get a discouraging result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>range(titanicData$age)</code></pre>
<p>Can you imagine how to solve this? You guessed correctly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>range(titanicData$age, na.rm = T)</code></pre>
<p>This will output the minimum and maximum values in the vector
<code>titanicData$age</code>.</p>
<p>The interquartile range (or IQR) is the difference between the third
quartile and the first quartile; in other words the range covered by the
middle half of the data. It can be calculated easily with IQR().</p>
<pre class="r"><code>IQR(titanicData$age, na.rm = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Note: you can also obtain the quartiles and IQR by running
<code>summary</code> on the data. You don’t need to use
<code>na.rm=T</code>. In fact, summary will actually report whether
there are missing data or not. The third quartile is 41 and the first
quartile is 21, so the difference is 41 – 21 = 20:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(titanicData$age)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>summary()</code> function told you that
<code>titanicData$age</code> has 680 values that are NAs. What
proportion of values are NAs?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>680/length(titanicData$age) #divide the nr of NAs by total length</code></pre>
<p>More generally, you might not want to have to type in that number
yourself. How can you ask R whether an element in the vector is NA or
not?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>is.na(titanicData$age)[1] #boolean. Asks if first element of vector is NA

is.na(titanicData$age) # returns a boolean vector with TRUE/FALSE for each position</code></pre>
<p>Okay, but what if you wanted to know <em>which</em> elements of this
vector are NAs?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanicAgeNAs&lt;-which(is.na(titanicData$age))
titanicAgeNAs</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>which</code> gives the TRUE indices of a logical
object. For every position where <code>is.na(titanicData$age)</code>
returned <code>TRUE</code>, <code>which</code> will tell you the index
of that element.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use <code>titanicAgeNAs</code> as index for
<code>titanicData$age</code> and it will return all positions in the
vector that are NAs:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanicData$age[titanicAgeNAs]</code></pre>
<p>So going back to the question of hwo to calculate the proportion of
elements in <code>titanicData$age</code> that are NAs, you could do:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum(is.na(titanicData$age))/length(titanicData$age)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sum()</code> command on a boolean will count each
<code>TRUE</code> instance as a <code>1</code> and each
<code>FALSE</code> instance as a <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>What if you wanted to get rid of all the rows in your data.frame that
have NA in any of the columns?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nrow(titanicData) #number of rows in the object
titanicData2&lt;-na.omit(titanicData)
nrow(titanicData2) #number of rows in the object minus the rows with NAs
#make sure this makes sense
nrow(titanicData)-nrow(titanicData2)</code></pre>
<p>This gives <code>680</code>, exactly the number of NAs for variable
<code>age</code>, which tells us that none of the other columns have NAs
in other rows, since <code>na.omit()</code> acts on the entire
data.frame.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-a-soft-intro-to-the-tidyverse-packages"
class="section level2">
<h2>A soft intro to the Tidyverse packages</h2>
<p><em>Note</em>: most of the material in this section comes from three
sources: Rstudio, <a
href="https://bookdown.org/ybrandvain/Applied_Biostats_Fall_2022/viz1.html">Y.
Brandvain’s online book</a> A great part about R is that many people
have written packages to help with specific tasks.</p>
<p>The tidyverse refers to both a set of packages, and a way to do
things in R. The tidyverse packages we use the most in this course
are:</p>
<p><code>ggplot2</code>: For making plots. <code>dplyr</code>: For
summarizing and handling data. <code>tidyr</code>: For converting data
from wide to long format (and vice versa). <code>readr</code>: For
reading in data. <code>forcats</code>: For controlling the order of
categorical variables.</p>
<p>We will use the tibble, stringr, and purrr packages less often if at
all (although I use them often). But <code>ggplot2</code> and
<code>dplyr</code> are crucial in this day and age.</p>
<p><img src="images/tidyverse.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>Why? One major reason for this is that the focus on a shared and
coherent philosophy, grammar and data structure makes the tidyverse
easier to teach and learn than base R. However, there are still
challenges to learning and teaching the tidyverse, the two major
challenges are</p>
<p>It takes time to learn and appreciate the shared philosophy and data
structure. Many people first learned R using base R, so it can be
frustrating to start to learn again. Overcoming challenge (1) takes time
but is helped by reflecting on why and how code works when it works, and
fails when it fails (rather than copying and pasting code that works),
and continually asking questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-a-note-about-tibbles" class="section level2">
<h2>A note about tibbles</h2>
<p>“Tibbles” are a new modern data frame. It keeps many important
features of the original data frame. It removes many of the outdated
features. They are another amazing feature added to R by Hadley Wickham.
We will use them in the tidyverse to replace the older outdated
dataframe that we just learned about.</p>
<p>If you use <code>readr::read_csv</code> to read in a .csv file,
instead of the default base R <code>read.csv</code>, your data will be
imported as a tibble.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readr)
data_link &lt;- &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ybrandvain/datasets/master/FlowerColourVisits.csv&quot;
flower_visits  &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = data_link) # get the data into R and assign it to flower visits</code></pre>
<p>Notice that whem data is read in as <code>tibble</code>, it gives you
some summary info. Normally you’d have to run additional commands to see
those.</p>
<div id="section-compared-to-data-frames" class="section level3">
<h3>Compared to Data Frames</h3>
<ul>
<li>A tibble never changes the input type.</li>
<li>No more worry of characters being automatically turned into
strings.</li>
<li>A tibble can have columns that are lists.</li>
<li>A tibble can have non-standard variable names.</li>
<li>Can start with a number or contain spaces.</li>
<li>To use this refer to these in a backtick.E.g.
“my_dataframe$<code>0 weird col name</code>”</li>
<li>It never creates row names.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-structure-of-a-good-data-file" class="section level2">
<h2>Structure of a good data file</h2>
<p>Data files appear in many formats, and different formats are
sometimes preferable for different tasks. But there is one way to
structure data—called “long” format—that is extremely useful for most
things that you will want to do in statistics and R.</p>
<p>Long format is actually very simple. Every row in the data set is a
unique individual. Every column is a variable being measured on those
individuals.</p>
<p>For example, here are some data about the tongue and palate lengths
of several species of bats. There are three variables in that data set,
the species name, tongue length, and palate length. Here each
“individual” is a species. Here is that data in long format—each row is
an individual. There are three columns, one for each variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bat_tongue&lt;-read.csv(&quot;data/BatTongues.csv&quot;)
str(bat_tongue)</code></pre>
<div id="section-creating-a-data-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Creating a data file</h3>
<p>When you have new data that you want to get into the computer in a
format that R can read, it is often easiest to do this outside of R. A
spreadsheet program like Excel (or a freely available program like
OpenOffice Calc) is a straightforward way to create a .csv file that R
can read.</p>
<p>In your spreadsheet program, open a new window with New Workbook
under the File menu. (In OpenOffice, under the File menu, choose New and
then Spreadsheet.) In the first row of your new spreadsheet, write your
variable names, one for each column. (Be sure to give them good names
that will work in R. Mainly, don’t have any spaces in a variable name
and make sure that it doesn’t start with a number or contain punctuation
marks. See Week 1 for more about naming variables.)</p>
<p>On the rows immediately below that first row, enter the data for each
individual, in the correct column. Here’s what the spreadsheet would
look like for the bat data after they are entered:</p>
<p><img src="images/spreadsheet%20view.jpeg" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-saving-as-.csv" class="section level2">
<h2>Saving as .csv</h2>
<p>Saving a spreadsheet in a format that R can read is very
straightforward. In these labs, we are using .csv files (which stands
for comma separated values). Once you have made your spreadsheet, under
“File” click on “Save as…”. This will open a dialog box. First, give the
file a name with the extension .csv at the end. We used
“BatTongues.csv”. Then choose what folder you want to save the file
in.</p>
<p>Finally, choose the right format for the file. The right format is
“Comma separated values” which you can choose from after Format: in the
dialog box. It might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-14%20at%2012.13.10%20PM.png"
style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<p>In the resulting file, the first line will be a header that lists the
names of each column (variable). After that there will be one line for
each individual. All the variable names in the first row and the
variable values in the later rows will be separated by commas, hence the
name of the format. If you opened the .csv file in a text editor, it
would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-14%20at%2012.13.16%20PM.png"
style="width:60.0%" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-tidy-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy data</h2>
<p>Above we introduce the tidyverse ecosystem of tools for R. Tidyverse
tools can be useful and general because they rely on a certain and
predictable data structure known as “tidy data.”</p>
<p>Characteristics of tidy data</p>
<ul>
<li>Each variable must have its own column.</li>
<li>Each observation must have its own row.</li>
<li>Each value must have its own cell.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-14%20at%2011.10.55%20AM.png"
style="width:80.0%" /></p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-14%20at%2011.11.04%20AM.png"
style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>A major benefit of the tidy data structure is that when data
structure is reliable, we can deal with diverse data sets in a
consistent way.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202022-09-14%20at%2011.27.11%20AM.png"
style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>When handed data to analyze, it is good practice to ask yourself if
it is tidy. If it isn’t, you can modify it and save a new version after
you’ve processed it. How?</p>
<p>There are many ways but here is one. Let’s say you wanted to change
something about <code>flower_visits</code> and then save that as a new
file.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(flower_visits) #this you know
#change column name from &quot;flower&quot; to &quot;Flower.ID&quot;

colnames(flower_visits)[1]&lt;-&quot;Flower.ID&quot;
head(flower_visits)

write.csv(x = flower_visits, file = &quot;my_flower_visits.csv&quot;, quote = F, sep = &quot;,&quot;) #write a file with comma separated columns and do not quote characters/strings</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the <code>files</code> pane on the right you should
now see your file there. Voilà! You changed a dataset to your liking
without changing the raw data.</p>

<h2>The dplyr package</h2>

<p>(That’s a buddy of mine on the tweet! And I agree)</p>
<p>We will learn about several useful functions for data wrangling from
the dplyr package, including: <code>filter</code>, <code>mutate</code>,
<code>select</code>, <code>summarise</code>, and a few others.</p>
<div id="section-filter" class="section level3">
<h3>filter()</h3>
<p><code>filter()</code> lets you use a logical test to extract specific
rows from a data frame. To use <code>filter()</code>, pass it the data
frame followed by one or more logical tests. <code>filter()</code> will
return every row that passes each logical test.</p>
<p>Let’s use the <code>iris</code> dataset from the
<code>datasets</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
data(datasets::iris)</code></pre>
<p>Check the structure of the object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(iris)
head(iris)
summary(iris) # 50 individuals of each of 3 species</code></pre>
<p>Here is a new function to have a glimpse of your data, from the dplyr
package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

glimpse(iris)</code></pre>
<p>Compare this with <code>strc()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str(iris)</code></pre>
<p>Check what are the levels for <code>Species</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#the names here refer to the second part of the species name, after the genus, Iris. 
levels(iris$Species) #Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica</code></pre>
<p>We can use <code>filter()</code> to select only the rows concerning
“virginica”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr) # you need to do this because there are other packages with functions called &quot;filter&quot; and R can get confused.
filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot;)
#another way to avoid confusions for R is to call the package before the function name, like this:
dplyr::filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What if you only wanted to see rows where the Species is “virginica”
AND the Petal.Width is lower than 2?</p>
<p>You can combine filters:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot;, Petal.Width&lt;2)
#or
filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot; &amp; Petal.Width&lt;2) #this is the equivalent to the line above. &quot;&amp;&quot; signifies AND in the world of logical operators, whereas | signifies OR.</code></pre>
<p>Like all dplyr functions, <code>filter()</code> returns a new data
frame for you to save or use. It doesn’t overwrite the old data
frame.</p>
<p>Caution! If you give <code>filter()</code> more than one logical
test, <code>filter()</code> will combine the tests with an implied
“and.” In other words, <code>filter()</code> will return only the rows
that return <code>TRUE</code> for every test. You can combine tests in
other ways with Boolean operators…</p>
<p>R uses boolean operators to combine multiple logical comparisons into
a single logical test. These include <code>&amp;</code> (<em>and</em>),
<code>|</code> (<em>or</em>), <code>!</code> (<em>not</em> or
<em>negation</em>), and <code>xor()</code> (<em>exactly or</em>).</p>
<p>Both <code>|</code> and <code>xor()</code> will return TRUE if one or
the other logical comparison returns TRUE. <code>xor()</code> differs
from <code>|</code> in that it will return FALSE if both logical
comparisons return TRUE. The name <em>xor</em> stands for <em>exactly
or</em>.</p>
<p>We saw this in Lab1, so if you need to recap that, it might be a good
idea…</p>
<p>If you want to save the output of <code>filter()</code>, you’ll need
to use the assignment operator, <code>&lt;-</code> (or
<code>=</code>).</p>
<p>Rerun the previous command and save the output to an object called
<code>virg_filt</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>virg_filt&lt;-filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot;, Petal.Width&lt;2)</code></pre>
<p>Good job! You can now see the results by running the name virg_filt
by itself. Or you can pass <code>virg_filt</code> to a function that
takes data frames as input.</p>
<p>Did you notice that this code used the double equal operator,
<code>==</code>? <code>==</code> is one of R’s logical comparison
operators. Comparison operators are key to using <code>filter()</code>.
Let’s look at an example using the OR operator.</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to filter the rows of <code>iris</code> that have
either “virginica” OR “setosa” in the <code>Species</code> column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot; | Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To check that this worked you could save the output into a variable
and then <code>table()</code> the <code>Species</code> column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>virg_set_filt&lt;-filter(iris, Species == &quot;virginica&quot; | Species == &quot;setosa&quot;)
table(virg_set_filt$Species)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>table()</code> command counts how many occurences of each
level of a factor exist in your data. Notice that although there are
zero occurrences of “versicolor” in your object, the level exists
because it is inherited from the parent object.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-common-mistakes" class="section level3">
<h3>Common mistakes</h3>
<p>In R, the order of operations doesn’t work like English. You can’t
write <code>filter(iris, Species == "setosa" | "virginica")</code>, even
though you might say “finds all measurements from I. setosa or I.
virginica”. Be sure to write out a <em>complete</em> test on each side
of a boolean operator.</p>
<p>Here are two more tips to help you use logical tests and Boolean
operators in R:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-section" class="section level2">
<h2></h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A useful short-hand for this problem is <code>x %in% y</code>. This
will select every row where <code>x</code> is one of the values in
<code>y</code>. We could use it to rewrite the code in the question
above:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>    set_or_virg &lt;- filter(iris, Species %in% c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot;))</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>As well as <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>, R also has
<code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>. Don’t use them with
<code>filter()</code>! You’ll learn when you should use them later.</li>
</ol>
<div id="section-filter-and-nas" class="section level3">
<h3>filter() and NAs</h3>
<p><code>filter()</code> only includes rows where the condition is
<code>TRUE</code>; it excludes both <code>FALSE</code> and
<code>NA</code> values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for
them explicitly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- data.frame(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x &gt; 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x &gt; 1) #is.na(x) OR x &gt;1</code></pre>
<p>Another useful dplyr filtering helper is <code>between()</code>. What
does it do?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>between(iris$Sepal.Length,5,6)</code></pre>
<p>If you add the command <code>which</code>, you get the index of the
positions in the vector that fullfill the requirement of being between 5
and 6.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>which(between(iris$Sepal.Length,5,6))</code></pre>

<div id="section-add-new-variables-with-mutate" class="section level3">
<h3>Add new variables with mutate()</h3>
<p>A data set often contains information that you can use to compute new
variables. <code>mutate()</code> helps you compute those variables.
Since <code>mutate()</code> always adds new columns to the end of a
dataset, we’ll start by creating a narrow dataset which will let us see
the new variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-select" class="section level3">
<h3>select()</h3>
<p>You can select a subset of variables by name with the
<code>select()</code> function in <code>dplyr</code>. Run the code below
to see the narrow data set that <code>select()</code> creates.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-mutate" class="section level3">
<h3>mutate()</h3>
<p>The code below creates two new variables with dplyr’s
<code>mutate()</code> function. <code>mutate()</code> returns a new data
frame that contains the new variables appended to a copy of the original
data set. Take a moment to imagine what this will look like, and then

</div>
<div id="section-summarise" class="section level3">
<h3>summarise()</h3>
<p><code>summarise()</code> collapses a data frame to a single row of
summaries. You get to choose how many summaries appear in the row and
how they are computed:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanicData&lt;-read.csv(&quot;data/titanic.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = F)
head(titanicData,2)
require(dplyr) #again, this makes R less confused about where the function &quot;summarise&quot; is coming from
summarise(titanicData, Nr_Female = sum(sex==&quot;female&quot; &amp; survive == &#39;yes&#39;, na.rm = TRUE),
                  Nr_total = sum(survive == &#39;yes&#39;, na.rm = TRUE) )</code></pre>
<p>(We’ll come back to what that <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> means very
shortly.)</p>
<p>Notice that the syntax of <code>summarise()</code> is similar to
<code>mutate()</code>. As with <code>mutate()</code>, you give
summarise:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The name of a data frame to transform</li>
<li>One or more column names to appear in the transformed output. Each
column name is set equal to the R expression that will generate the
content of the column.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main difference between <code>summarise()</code> and
<code>mutate()</code> is the type of function that you use to generate
the new columns. <code>mutate()</code> takes functions that return an
entire vector of output (to append to the original data frame).
<code>summarise()</code> takes functions that return a single value (or
summary). These values will appear in a new data frame that has only one
row.</p>
<p><code>mutate()</code> will always return the new variables appended
to a copy of the original data. If you want to return only the new
variables, use <code>transmute()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-arrange" class="section level3">
<h3>arrange()</h3>
<p>You might recall that arranging data in R can be quite cumbersome.
Let’s look at <code>iris</code> again and try to rearrange the
data.frame so that it’s ordered by Petal.Length (smallest to highest
value).</p>
<p>One way to do this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>order(iris$Petal.Length) #this gives you the index of the Petal.Length vector in the order they should be if the vector was ordered.

iris$Petal.Length[order(iris$Petal.Length)] #this orders the column Petal.Length only

iris[order(iris$Petal.Length),] #order the entire data.frame based on the column Petal.Length</code></pre>
<p>Now the <code>arrange</code> way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>arrange(iris, Petal.Length) #that&#39;s all!

arrange(iris, -Petal.Length,) #this arranges it by descending petal length values</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-using-the-pipe-operator" class="section level2">
<h2>Using the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> operator</h2>
<p>In the previous section we learned how to do a bunch of things to
data. For example, in our toad dataset, below, we</p>
<p>Use the mutate() function made a new column for BMI by dividing
weight by height. Sort the data with the arrange() function. We also saw
how we could select() columns, and filter() for rows based on logical
statements.</p>
<p>We did each of these things one at a time, often reassigning
variables a bunch. Now, we see a better way, we combine operations with
the pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> operator.</p>
<p>Say you want to string together a few things – like you want make a
new tibble, called <code>sorted_titanic</code> by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only retaining people with age <code>&gt;</code> 15</li>
<li>Calculating the proportion of females who survived</li>
<li>Sorting the data by age</li>
<li>Getting rid of the column with the home_destination</li>
</ul>
<p>The pipe operator, %&gt;%, makes this pretty clean by allowing us to
pass results from one operation to another.</p>
<p>%&gt;% basically tells R to take the data and keep going!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sorted_titanic &lt;- titanicData     %&gt;% # initial data
  na.omit()  %&gt;% #omit rows containing NAs
  dplyr::filter(survive == &quot;yes&quot;) %&gt;% # sruvived
  dplyr::filter(age &gt; 15)         %&gt;% #age &gt;15
  dplyr::mutate(PropF = sum(sex==&#39;female&#39;)/length(sex))   %&gt;% # calculate PropF
  dplyr::arrange(age)                    %&gt;% # sort by age
  dplyr::select(-home_destination)             # remove home destination

sorted_titanic

glimpse(sorted_titanic)

dim(titanicData) #dimensions: # rows &amp;  # cols

<div id="section-the-ggplot2-package" class="section level2">
<h2>The ggplot2 package</h2>
<p><em>Note: most of the material in this section comes from Y.
Brandvain’s Applied Biostatistics online book. </em></p>
<p>We generally think of two extremes of the goals of data
visualization</p>
<p>In <em>exploratory</em> visualizations we aim to identify any
interesting patterns in the data, we also conduct quality control to see
if there are patterns indicating mistakes or biases in our data, and to
think about appropriate transformations of data. On the whole, our goal
in exploratory data analysis is to understand the stories in the
data.</p>
<p>In <em>explanatory</em> visualizations we aim to communicate our
results to a broader audience. Here our goals are communication and
persuasion. When developing explanatory plots we consider our audience
(scientists? consumers? experts?) and how we are communicating (talk?
website? paper?).</p>
<p>The <code>ggplot2</code> package in R is well suited for both
purposes of data visualization. Today we focus on exploratory
visualization in <code>ggplot2</code> because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are the starting point of all statistical analyses.</li>
<li>You can do them with less <code>ggplot2</code> knowledge.</li>
<li>They take less time to make than explanatory plots.</li>
<li>Later in the term we will show how we can use <code>ggplot2</code>
to make high quality explanatory plots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether developing an explanatory or exploratory plot, you should
think hard about the biology you hope to convey before jumping into a
plot. Ask yourself</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you hope to learn from this plot?</li>
<li>Which is the response variable (we usually place that on the
y-axis)?</li>
<li>Are data numeric or categorical?</li>
<li>If they are categorical are they ordinal, and if so what order
should they be in?</li>
</ul>
<p><em><em>The answers to these questions should guide our data
visualization strategy, as this is a key step in our statistical
analysis of a dataset. The best plots should evoke an immediate
understanding of the (potentially complex) data. Put another way, a plot
should highlight both the biological question and its
answer.</em></em></p>
<p>Before jumping into making a plot in R, it is often useful to take
this step back, think about your main biological question, and take a
pencil and paper to sketch some ideas and potential outcomes.</p>
<p><a
href="https://vimeo.com/747889723?embedded=true&amp;source=vimeo_logo&amp;owner=183870356">Here</a>
is a cool video by Y. Brandvain explaining how ggplot2 ‘thinks’.</p>
<p><code>ggplot2</code> is built on a framework for building plots
called the grammar of graphics. A major idea here is that plots are made
up of data that we map onto aesthetic attributes.</p>
<p>Lets unpack this sentence, because there’s a lot there.</p>
<p>Say we wanted to make a very simple plot e.g. observations for
categorical data, or a simple histogram for a single continuous
variable. Here we are mapping this variable onto a single aesthetic
attribute – the x-axis.</p>
<p><a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html">Here</a> is a
book about <code>ggplot2</code> written by its creator, Hadley
Wickham</p>
<p>The function <code>ggplot()</code> allows us to graph most kinds of
data relatively simply. Its syntax is slightly odd but very flexible.
We’ll show specific commands for several types of plots below.</p>
<p>To begin, remember to load the package ggplot2 with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>To make a graph with <code>ggplot()</code>, you need to specify at
least two elements in your command:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first uses the function <code>ggplot()</code> itself, to specify
which data frame you want to use and also which variables are to be
plotted.</li>
<li>The second part tells R what kind of graph to make, using a
<code>geom()</code> function. The odd part is that these two parts are
put together with a + sign. It’s simplest to see this with an example.
We’ll draw a histogram with <code>ggplot()</code> in the next
section.</li>
</ul>
<div id="section-histograms" class="section level3">
<h3>Histograms</h3>
<p>A histogram represents the frequency distribution of a numerical
variable in a sample.</p>
<p>Let’s see how to make a basic histogram using the age data from the
Titanic data set. Make sure you have loaded the data (using read.csv)
into a data frame called titanicData.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanicData &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;data/titanic.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the code to make a simple histogram of age:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram()
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
## Warning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<p>Notice that there are two functions called here, put together in a
single command with a plus sign. The first function is
<code>ggplot()</code>, and it has two input arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listed first is <code>titanicData</code>; this is the name of the
data frame containing the variables that we want to graph.</li>
<li>The second input to ggplot is an <code>aes()</code> function. In
this case, the <code>aes()</code> function tells R that we want age to
be the x-variable (i.e. the variable that is displayed along the
x-axis). (The aes stands for “aesthetics”,” but if you’re like us this
won’t help you remember it any better.)</li>
<li>The second function in this command is geom_histogram(). This is the
part that tells R that the “geometry” of our plot should be a
histogram.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not the most beautiful graph in the world, but it conveys the
information. At the end of this lab we’ll see a couple of options that
can make a ggplot graph look a little better.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-bar-graphs" class="section level3">
<h3>Bar graphs</h3>
<p>A bar graph plots the frequency distribution of a categorical
variable.</p>
<p>In <code>ggplot()</code>, the syntax for a bar graph is very similar
to that for a histogram. For example, here is a bar graph for the
categorical variable sex in the titanic data set. Aside from specifying
a different variable for <code>x</code>, we use a different geom
function here, geom_bar.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=sex)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;count&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-boxplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Boxplots</h3>
<p>A boxplot is a convenient way of showing the frequency distribution
of a numerical variable in multiple groups (i.e., a categorical
variable). Here’s the code to draw a boxplot for age in the titanic data
set, separately for each sex:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=sex, y=age)) + geom_boxplot()
## Warning: Removed 680 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>y</code> variable here is age, and
<code>x</code> is the categorical variable sex that winds up on the
x-axis. See the result below, and look at where the variables are. The
other new feature here is the new geom function,
<code>geom_boxplot()</code>.</p>
<p>Here the thick bar in the middle of each boxplot is the median of
that group. The upper and lower bounds of the box extend from the first
to the third quartile. (The “first quartile” is the 25th percentile of
the data–the value which is bigger than 25% of the other values. The
“third quartile” is the 75th percentile– the value bigger than 3/4 of
the other values.)</p>
<p>The vertical lines are called whiskers, and they cover most of the
range of the data (except when data points are pretty far from the
median (see text), when they are plotted as individual dots, as on the
male boxplot).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-violin-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Violin plots</h3>
<p>They share many similarities with a boxplot, but unlike boxplots they
show a mirrored image of the smoothed distribution of the numerical
variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=sex, y=age)) + geom_violin()</code></pre>
<p>Violin plot with points (strip chart) overlaid:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=sex, y=age)) + geom_violin() + geom_point()</code></pre>
<p>This is not great for seeing the points because they are on top of
each other, so we could add some jitter:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(titanicData, aes(x=sex, y=age)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width=0.2) #feel free to play with this width</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-scatterplots" class="section level3">
<h3>Scatterplots</h3>
<p>The last graphical style that we will cover here is the scatter plot,
which shows the relationship between two numerical variables.</p>
<p>The titanic data set does not have two numerical variables, so let’s
use a different data set—the example from Figure 2.3-2 of Whitlock and
Schluter, showing the relationship between the ornamentation of father
guppies and the sexual attractiveness of their sons. You can load the
data for that example with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>guppyFatherSonData &lt;-read.csv(&quot;data/chap02e3bGuppyFatherSonAttractiveness.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To make a scatter plot of the variables fatherOrnamentation and
sonAttractiveness with ggplot, you need to specify the x and y
variables, and use <code>geom_point()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(guppyFatherSonData,   
  aes(x = fatherOrnamentation, 
  y = sonAttractiveness)) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-better-looking-graphics" class="section level3">
<h3>Better looking graphics</h3>
<p>The code we have listed here for graphics barely scratches the
surface of what ggplot, and R as a whole, are capable of. Not only are
there far more choices about the kinds of plots available, but there are
many, many options for customizing the look and feel of each graph. You
can choose the font, the font size, the colors, the style of the axes
labels, etc., and you can customize the legends and axes legends nearly
as much as you want.</p>
<p>Let’s dig a little deeper into just a couple of options that you can
add to any of the forgoing graphs to make them look a little better. For
example, you can change the text of the x-axis label or the y-axis label
by using xlab or ylab. Let’s do that for the scatterplot, to make the
labels a little nicer to read for humans.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(guppyFatherSonData,   
    aes(x = fatherOrnamentation, y = sonAttractiveness)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab(&quot;Father&#39;s ornamentation&quot;) + 
    ylab(&quot;Son’s attractiveness&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The labels that we want to add are included in quotes inside the
<code>xlab</code> and <code>ylab</code> functions. Here is what
appears:</p>
<p>It can also be nice to remove the default gray background, to make
what some feel is a cleaner graph. Try adding</p>
<pre class="r"><code>+ theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p>to the end of one of your lines of code making a graph, to see
whether you prefer the result to the default design.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(guppyFatherSonData,   
    aes(x = fatherOrnamentation, y = sonAttractiveness)) +
    geom_point() +
    xlab(&quot;Father&#39;s ornamentation&quot;) + 
    ylab(&quot;Son’s attractiveness&quot;) + 
    theme_classic()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Getting help</h3>
<p>The help pages in R are the main source of help, but the amount of
detail might be off-putting for beginners. For example, to explore the
options for <code>ggplot()</code>, enter the following into the R
Console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>help(ggplot)
#or
?ggplot2</code></pre>
<p>This will cause the contents of the manual page for this function to
appear in the Help window in RStudio. These manual pages are often
frustratingly technical. What many of us do instead is simply google the
name of the function—there are a great number of resources online about
R.</p>
<p>There are also many introductory books available. A good one is
