 Welcome! This is a tutorial on R Markdown, which I've made in an R Markdown file! Now, as you're used to the tutorial format, you may be feeling a bit intimidated by this less structured mode of instruction, but I assure you, you will be doing the same coding you've always done, rmd files mostly change your formatting and the file is stored and exported.
